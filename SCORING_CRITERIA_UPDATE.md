1. **Removed Video Analysis** - Videos are NO LONGER analyzed by AI to drastically reduce costs
2. **Reduced Completeness Weight** - From 20-25% down to 10% since all required fields must be filled
3. **Increased Focus on Quality** - Experience and detail quality now weighted much higher

## Why These Changes?

### 1. Cost Reduction
- **Video analysis is expensive** - OpenAI charges per token, and analyzing video content/descriptions would significantly increase costs
- **New cost**: Still ~$0.0001 per score (extremely affordable)
- **Savings**: Potentially 30-50% reduction in token usage

### 2. Logical Scoring
- **Completeness isn't meaningful** - Users cannot create profiles without filling required fields
- **Quality over quantity** - Better to judge depth of information than just presence

### 3. Better Evaluation
- **Experience matters most** - For players and staff, real experience is more valuable than field completion
- **Details show effort** - Quality of written information demonstrates candidate's seriousness

## Updated Scoring Guidelines

| Score | Old Interpretation | New Interpretation |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 90-100 | Exceptional complete profile | **Exceptional detail and extensive experience** |
| 70-89 | Complete professional profile | **Strong profile with quality information** |
| 50-69 | Average with room for improvement | **Average with basic information** |
| 0-49 | Incomplete profile | **Minimal detail provided** |

## Code Example

### Updated Prompt Instructions:
```typescript
INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Evaluate the profile based on the scoring criteria above
2. Focus heavily on the QUALITY and DETAIL of information, not just quantity
3. Reward profiles with specific, detailed, and relevant information
4. Since all required fields must be filled to create a profile, completeness has minimal weight
5. Be critical - only exceptional profiles with rich, detailed information should score above 90
6. Average profiles with basic information should score around 50-60
7. Profiles with exceptional detail and relevant experience should score 70-90
8. DO NOT analyze or score videos - they are not part of the evaluation
```

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Profiles:
- No database migration needed
- Existing scores remain valid
- New profiles will use new criteria
- Consider re-scoring existing profiles if needed using batch function

### For Future Scoring:
- All new candidate profiles automatically use updated criteria
- No code changes needed in controllers/routes
- Scoring happens automatically in `user.service.ts`

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Will existing scores change?**  
A: No, existing scores in the database remain unchanged. Only new profiles will use the new criteria.

**Q: Can we still see if a profile has videos?**  
A: Yes! The `videos` field still exists in profiles. We just don't analyze them with AI.

**Q: What if we want to re-score old profiles?**  
A: Use the `batchGenerateProfileScores()` function to re-score existing profiles with new criteria.

**Q: Are videos still required for some roles?**  
A: Yes, video upload requirements haven't changed. We just don't analyze them with AI for scoring.
